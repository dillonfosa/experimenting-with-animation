# experimenting-with-animation

I utilized part of this tutorial https://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/06/02/smooth-vertical-or-horizontal-page-scrolling-with-jquery/
Combined uses of CSS to created a form of simple navigation.
Next I linked the Jquery to select a certain point to animate a smooth scrolling effect horizontaly when clicked.

Challenges faced were mainly the time which the D3.js Dounut would be triggered.
